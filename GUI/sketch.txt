                + third column is transactions
            ** How the column works : when opened, only the first column shows
                - when select one of the wallets , the incomesources and categories appears (if none , display "no sources" or "no categories")
                - when select one of the sources or categories , appears all the transaction form that source or to that categoriy
                - there is a color indication that you are selecting a wallet , a source or a category , if in which area , the add, edit and delete button will works for that wallet , source or category.
